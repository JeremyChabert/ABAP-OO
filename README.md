Hello everyone, welcome to ABAP-OO training. I hope you are all set for 2 days or more of fun learning about oriented object programming.

In this training, all the concepts introduced are related to the ABAP-OO programming. This means that some of the concepts introduced are **SPECIFIC** to SAP context development.

However, as we enter the paradigm of oriented object programming, for those with some knowledge about it, you'll find a lot of similarities with what other language are offering.

Let's start, shall we ?
