Hello everyone, welcome to ABAP-OO training. I hope you are all set for 2 days or more of fun learning about oriented object programming.

In this training, all the concepts introduced are related to the ABAP-OO programming. This means that some of the concepts introduced are only true in SAP context development.

However, as we enter the paradigm of oriented object programming, for those with some knowledge about it, you'll find a lot of similarities with what other languages are using.

Let's start, shall we ?
